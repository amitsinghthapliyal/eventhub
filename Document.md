## ðŸ“Œ Project: EventHub â€“ Take Home Assignment

---

## 1. Project Overview & Key Decisions

This is a simplified event management web application built using **Next.js** and **SQLite (in-memory)**. The app allows users to:
- View and filter a list of upcoming events
- See event details
- Register for events
- (Admin only) View analytics for popular events and daily stats

---

## 2. Tech Stack & Setup

### Frontend
- **Next.js** with **React**
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

### Backend
- **Next.js API Routes**
- **SQLite (in-memory)** â€” with ability to persist via file fallback if required
- **Raw SQL** used for maximum control and performance

### Setup Instructions
1. Configure `.env.local` (optional, since SQLite is in-memory)
2. Run `sql/schema.sql` to create tables
3. Install packages `npm install`
4. Start app: `npm run dev`

## 3. Performance Considerations
1. Added lazy loading and pagination on UI & apis to reduce payload size.
2. Optimized sql queries.
3. Reduced API response size by excluding redundant data, leading to faster client-side rendering and lower bandwidth usage.
